# Landing Page Generation — AI Pipeline Orchestration

You orchestrate the 4-agent AI pipeline that generates professional landing pages. Your job is to set up the session correctly, trigger generation, monitor progress, and verify output quality.

## Prerequisites

- `user_token`, `brand_id`, `ta_groups`, `aspect_ratio`, `locale` from previous phases
- Read `CLAUDE.md` for tool signatures
- Read `lib/mcp-patterns.md` for the create-and-poll pattern

## The AI Pipeline (runs automatically in the backend)

```
1. Strategist Agent (Gemini Flash)
   → Analyzes brand, TA, market positioning
   → Outputs: marketing strategy, key messages, USPs

2. Architect Agent (Gemini Flash)
   → Designs page layout, stripe structure, copywriting
   → Outputs: stripe plan (headlines, body text, CTA per stripe)

3. Factory Agent (Gemini Pro Image)
   → Generates visual stripes with embedded text
   → Outputs: high-quality images with text rendered into them

4. Stripe Reflector (Gemini Flash)
   → Quality-checks each stripe
   → Flags issues: text readability, brand consistency, layout balance
```

You don't call these agents individually — `generate_session` triggers the entire pipeline.

## Phase 1: Create Session

```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "create_session", {
  "user_token": token,
  "session_name": "[Product] Landing Page",
  "brand_name": brand_name,
  "product_name": product_name,
  "base_description": product_description,
  "conversation_id": conversation_id  // optional, for context continuity
})
→ Returns: { "session_id": "sess_..." }
```

## Phase 2: Configure Session

Set TA groups, aspect ratio, and locale:

```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "update_session", {
  "user_token": token,
  "session_id": session_id,
  // Set TA config, aspect ratio, locale as needed
})
```

## Phase 2.5: Save TA Groups to Session (CRITICAL)

Before generation, TA options must be saved into the session:

### Step 1: Save selected TAs
```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "update_session", {
  "user_token": token,
  "session_id": session_id,
  "data_json": "{\"wizard_ta_groups\": [<selected TA objects from generate_ta_options>]}"
})
```

### Step 2: Get assigned TA group IDs
```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "get_ta_statuses", {
  "user_token": token,
  "session_id": session_id
})
→ Returns: [{ "ta_group_id": "ta_1", "ta_name": "...", ... }]
```

## Phase 2.8: Upload Additional Assets (if user provides files)

If the user provides additional images during this phase (product photos, screenshots, etc.),
upload them and write into the session BEFORE triggering generation:

```
# Step 1: Get signed URL
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "get_asset_upload_url", {
  "user_token": token,
  "brand_id": brand_id,
  "filename": "product-photo.jpg",
  "asset_type": "product",
  "content_type": "image/jpeg"
})
→ { "upload_url": "...", "public_url": "..." }

# Step 2: Upload
# bash: curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" -T "/path/to/file.jpg" "{upload_url}"

# Step 3: Write into session
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "update_session", {
  "user_token": token,
  "session_id": session_id,
  "data_json": "{\"wizard_shared_files\": {\"product_images\": [\"<public_url>\"]}}"
})
```

Must be done BEFORE `generate_session` — Factory reads images from session at generation time.

## Phase 3: Trigger Generation

### Step 1: Set expectations BEFORE triggering

**MANDATORY** — Always tell the user what to expect before starting generation:

```
This process takes about 1-3 minutes. The AI pipeline has 4 stages:

1. Strategy — Analyzing your brand and audience positioning
2. Layout — Designing page structure and writing copy
3. Image Generation — Creating visual stripes with embedded text
4. Quality Check — Verifying readability and brand consistency

I'll keep you updated on progress as each stage completes.
```

### Step 2: Trigger the pipeline

```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "generate_session", {
  "user_token": token,
  "session_id": session_id,
  "ta_group_ids_json": "[\"ta_1\"]",
  "requested_stripe_count": 8
})
→ Returns: { "message": "Started generation...", "status": "processing", "project_ids": ["..."] }
```

**Important**:
- `ta_group_ids_json` is REQUIRED — JSON array of IDs from Phase 2.5 Step 2.
- `requested_stripe_count`: set to 8 for 8-page LP (0 = backend default ~10).
- This is an async operation. The backend runs the 4-agent pipeline which takes 30-120 seconds.

## Phase 4: Poll for Completion + Keep User Engaged

Poll every 5 seconds, max 60 attempts (5 minutes):

```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "get_session", {
  "user_token": token,
  "session_id": session_id
})
→ Returns: { "status": "generating" | "complete" | "error", ... }
```

### Progress Reporting + User Engagement (MANDATORY)

Keep the user informed during polling. On the FIRST poll response, show progress AND preview what they'll be able to do next:

```
Generating your landing page...

[00:05] Strategist analyzing your brand and audience...

While we wait, here's what you'll be able to do once it's ready:

- Preview: You'll get a clickable sales page link to view on any device
- Edit: You can edit any text, image, or layout directly
- Screenshot editing: Take a screenshot, circle what to change, and tell me
- SEO: Auto-generate meta tags, schema markup, and search keywords
- Crop & adjust: Fine-tune individual stripe images
- Homepage: Embed the LP into a full website

I'll share all these links once generation is done!
```

Continue with stage-based updates as polling proceeds:

```
[00:15] Architect designing page layout and copy...
[00:30] Factory generating visual stripes...
[00:45] Quality check in progress...
[01:00] Almost done — finalizing...

Generation complete! [X] stripes created.
```

### Error Handling

- **"error" status**: Report the error, offer to retry
- **Timeout (60 polls)**: "Generation is taking longer than expected. Want to wait more or check later?"
- **Partial generation**: Some stripes may fail — report which ones and offer to regenerate individually

## Phase 5: Verify Output

### List all stripes
```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "list_stripes", {
  "user_token": token,
  "session_id": session_id
})
```

### Check each stripe
For key stripes (hero, CTA), inspect detail:
```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "get_stripe_detail", {
  "user_token": token,
  "campaign_id": campaign_id,
  "stripe_idx": 0
})
```

### Quality checklist
- [ ] All expected stripes generated (typically 4-8)
- [ ] Hero stripe has clear headline and product image
- [ ] CTA stripe has clear call-to-action button
- [ ] Text is readable and correctly positioned
- [ ] Brand colors are consistent
- [ ] No error stripes or blank images

## Phase 6: Present Results + All Links (MANDATORY)

### Step 1: Create share token
```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "create_share_token", {
  "user_token": token,
  "campaign_id": campaign_id
})
→ Returns: { "share_token": "abc123" }
```

### Step 2: Get public landing page data
```
mcp_tool_call("landing_ai_mcp", "get_public_landing_page", {
  "user_token": token,
  "campaign_id": campaign_id
})
→ Returns: full LP config with stitched_image_url and per-stripe background_urls
```

### Step 3: Present ALL links and next actions to user

**MANDATORY** — After generation, present the full set of links and capabilities:

```
LP Generated Successfully!

Links:
1. Sales Page (interactive preview):
   https://landingai.info/{locale}/landing-page?id={campaign_id}

2. Visual Editor (drag & drop editing):
   https://landingai.info/{locale}/editor?id={campaign_id}

3. Full-Length Image (static stitched preview):
   {stitched_image_url}

4. Share Token: {share_token}

Stripe Overview:
1. {headline_1} — {stripe_type_1}
2. {headline_2} — {stripe_type_2}
... (list all)

What you can do now:
A) Edit text, images, or layout → just tell me what to change
B) Screenshot editing → open the sales page, take a screenshot, circle what to change, paste here
C) SEO optimization → I'll generate meta tags, schema markup, and keywords
D) Crop & adjust → fine-tune individual stripe images
E) Build homepage → embed this LP into a full website (/mx-homepage)
F) Publish → push to social media or run ads (/mx-publish)
G) Generate another variant (different TA or aspect ratio)

Tip: Open the sales page link on your phone to see the mobile experience!
```

### Step 4: CTA Button Check (MANDATORY)

After presenting the LP, **always** check the CTA stripe and ask about the button destination:

1. Find the CTA stripe from the stripe list (usually the last stripe)
2. Read its `cta_text` and `cta_url` values from stripe detail
3. Proactively ask:

```
The CTA button currently says "[cta_text]" and links to [cta_url or "nowhere (no URL set)"].

Want to set the button destination? Common options:
- Your website URL
- LINE official account link
- Booking/appointment page
- Product purchase link
- Contact form

Just paste the URL and I'll update it for you.
```

If `cta_url` is empty or set to a placeholder, emphasize that it needs to be set before publishing.

**CRITICAL RULES for link presentation:**
- The **sales page link** (landingai.info) is the PRIMARY link to show — this is the actual rendered page
- The **visual editor link** is the SECONDARY link for self-service editing
- The stitched_image_url is a tertiary static preview
- If multiple LPs were generated (different TAs), provide a sales page link for EACH campaign_id
- The locale in the URL should match the user's language (zh-TW, en, ja, etc.)
- ALWAYS include the visual editor link — many users prefer drag-and-drop

## Generating Both Aspect Ratios

If user selected "both" in Phase 2:

1. Generate 16:9 version first (steps 1-6)
2. Create a second session with same config but `aspect_ratio="9:16"`
3. Generate 9:16 version (steps 1-6)
4. Present both results together

```
Both versions generated!

16:9 (Landscape): [campaign_id_landscape] — [X] stripes
  Sales Page: https://landingai.info/{locale}/landing-page?id={campaign_id_landscape}
  Editor: https://landingai.info/{locale}/editor?id={campaign_id_landscape}

9:16 (Portrait):  [campaign_id_portrait] — [Y] stripes
  Sales Page: https://landingai.info/{locale}/landing-page?id={campaign_id_portrait}
  Editor: https://landingai.info/{locale}/editor?id={campaign_id_portrait}

Which version would you like to edit first?
```

## Output

Store for subsequent phases:
- `session_id` — for content import (publishing)
- `campaign_id` — for editing and export (primary identifier)
- `share_token` — for public sharing
- `stripe_count` — number of generated stripes
- `stitched_image_url` — full LP preview image
- `stripe_urls[]` — per-stripe preview images
